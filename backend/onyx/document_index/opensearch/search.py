        Matches:

          - Content vector
          - Keyword (title + content, match and phrase)

        Normalization is not performed here.

        https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/query-dsl/compound/hybrid/

        NOTE: Each query is independent during the search phase, there is no
        backfilling of scores for missing query components. What this means is
        that if a document was a good vector match but did not show up for
        keyword, it gets a score of 0 for the keyword component of the hybrid
        scoring. This is not as bad as just disregarding a score though as there
        is normalization applied after. So really it is "increasing" the missing
        score compared to if it was included and the range was renormalized.
        This does however mean that between docs that have high scores for say
        the vector field, the keyword scores between them are completely ignored
        unless they also showed up in the keyword query as a reasonably high
        match. TLDR, this is a bit of unique funky behavior but it seems ok.

        NOTE: Options considered and rejected:
        - minimum_should_match: Since it's hybrid search and users often provide
          semantic queries, there is often a lot of terms, and very low number
          of meaningful keywords (and a low ratio of keywords).
        - fuzziness AUTO: Typo tolerance (0/1/2 edit distance by term length).
          It's mostly for typos as the analyzer ("english" by default) already
          does some stemming and tokenization. In testing datasets, this makes
          recall slightly worse. It also is less performant so not really any
          reason to do it.

        retrieved. This function returns a list of such subfilters.
        See https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/query-dsl/compound/bool/

        Args:
            tenant_state: Tenant state containing the tenant ID.
            include_hidden: Whether to include hidden documents.
            access_control_list: Access control list for the documents to
                retrieve. If None, there is no restriction on the documents that
                can be retrieved. If not None, only public documents can be
                retrieved, or non-public documents where at least one acl
                provided here is present in the document's acl list.
            source_types: If supplied, only documents of one of these source
                types will be retrieved.
            tags: If supplied, only documents with an entry in their metadata
                list corresponding to a tag will be retrieved.
            document_sets: If supplied, only documents with at least one
                document set ID from this list will be retrieved.
            user_file_ids: If supplied, only document IDs in this list will be
                retrieved.
            project_id: If not None, only documents with this project ID in user
                projects will be retrieved.
            persona_id: If not None, only documents whose personas array
                contains this persona ID will be retrieved.
            time_cutoff: Time cutoff for the documents to retrieve. If not None,
                Documents which were last updated before this date will not be
                returned. For documents which do not have a value for their last
                updated time, we assume some default age of
                ASSUMED_DOCUMENT_AGE_DAYS for when the document was last
                updated.
            min_chunk_index: The minimum chunk index to retrieve, inclusive. If
                None, no minimum chunk index will be applied.
            max_chunk_index: The maximum chunk index to retrieve, inclusive. If
                None, no maximum chunk index will be applied.
            max_chunk_size: The type of chunk to retrieve, specified by the
                maximum number of tokens it can hold. If None, no filter will be
                applied for this. Defaults to None.
                NOTE: See DocumentChunk.max_chunk_size.
            document_id: The document ID to retrieve. If None, no filter will be
                applied for this. Defaults to None.
                WARNING: This filters on the same property as user_file_ids.
                Although it would never make sense to supply both, note that if
                user_file_ids is supplied and does not contain document_id, no
                matches will be retrieved.
            attached_document_ids: Document IDs explicitly attached to the
                assistant. If provided along with hierarchy_node_ids, documents
                matching EITHER criteria will be retrieved (OR logic).
            hierarchy_node_ids: Hierarchy node IDs (folders/spaces) attached to
                the assistant. Matches chunks where ancestor_hierarchy_node_ids
                contains any of these values.

        Returns:
